Inheritance is "is-a" relationship, the code says:
    a Car is-a Engine & Wheel, which is logically wrong,
    the is-a word is basically set to say in heritance should only be used
    (if used at all) when it's a relationship is of the genre of a parent and child.

This means that you should use a Composition instead, 
which defines this kidn of relationship well.
