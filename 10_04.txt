Considering the question, it implies that every Mammal gives milk
(and some other functions),

I think Penguins don't give milk? Nevermind not even a mammal.
Googled => "the duck-billed platypus and the echidna." 
don't give "Live birth", they lay eggs instead O_O.

Lesson:
    Somekind of abstractions (Considering inheritance is some form of it),
    might be correct currently,
    but turn out to be wrong later, or more like "needed to change" later.
