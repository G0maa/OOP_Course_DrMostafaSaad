Current issue is for each new service, M banks will essentially 
write the same piece of software,
similarly, for each new bank, it will implement software similar (If not identical)
to the one in the other banks.
(N * M).

I guess the start up (much more like government tbh), will think of an idea
to elminiate this amount of repating software development, which means 
it will work as a middle man, and it will develop the software only once.
(Wonder if they already exist.)

I speak no business :D, read the articles though.
I tried to sell some stuff before, I understood that careful planning is very important,
and Quality of the product isn't going to sell, at least by itself.

Most of startups fail as far as I know.
