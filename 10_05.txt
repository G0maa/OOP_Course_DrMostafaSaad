I guess we will make it with multiple inheritance?
    A problem we may face (which is not present here),
    is "crossing" تقاطع of functions,
    and/or need of redefinition of certain ones => make_sound() for instansce.

(Looks like I missed the questions entierly it was "has-a" not "is-a" relationship that is asked for.)
