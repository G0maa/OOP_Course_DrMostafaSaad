I/O hardware (with their classes): 
    - Keypad
    - CashDispenser
    - Screen
    - DepositSlot
Only one of each.

Firstly, `ATM` has to authenticate user against `BankDatabase`,
    `BankDatabase` contains account of (may be) said user.

`ATM` is connected with a only one `BacnkDatabase`, which contains many `Accounts`.

After authentication of said user,
ATM will allow user to varity of functions through `Transaction`, 
User can have unlimited transaction functions.

`Transaction` can have unlimited accesses to Bankdatabase,
each of which has a different kind of transaction function.

but for user to interact with `Transaction` he/she has to use I/O hardware.

When the user interacts with said hardware, each of which has his own class I suppose,
he will be able to use `Transaction` class functions which are:
    - Withdrawal
    - Deposit
    - Balance inequiry

BTW these functions are drived classes from transaction.
Each of the drived classes will deal in it's way with the I/O hardware,
aka each has their overridded functions that deals with I/O hardware.
