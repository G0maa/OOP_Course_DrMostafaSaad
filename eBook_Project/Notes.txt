Time: (Add 2 hour for various other stuff)
    - OOA (0 min):
        - Provided by Dr.
        - Meaning requirements.
    - OOD (4 hour 20 min): 
        - Lots of thinking back and forth.
        - Drawing UML.
    - OOP (29 hour - 25 min):
        - I started by going bottom-up approach, but aftere 1 Hour 30 Min I switched to
          top-down approach, the first is hard.

        - Five minutes I understood that the best idea is just to layout all classes & methods & data members.

        - During the programming I faced problems of "Is this really the responsability for that class?" a lot,
          also moving data between classes (when needed) stood to be a big problem, as I focused on only one design =>
          one Run() function that has everything in it FOR that class,
          aka it may need data from some other class before or after it.

        - At the 4 Hour 45 Minutes I tried compiling the program for the first time, showed lots of errors,
          mainly due to "Invalid use of incomplete type" 5 Minute search told me I should do it the C++ way,
          and make header files and what not so here I am.
        
        - I split them to files, which took quite a lot of time, I should have used some bot that exists
          somewhere to do the job for me, neveermind, I faced another problem, which is "Undefined refrence",
          I was stuck at it for a VERY VERY long time, I also failed to notice what is a compilation error
          and what is a linker error, anyway... I split them to files in hopes I'd solve the order of classes problem
          (something gets called before something), lastly to realize having bunch of "include "x.cpp"" doesn't help really,
          anyway, the problem I really had was that there's a deadlock between the eBookSystemIO class and Book class.
          this was at 8 Hour 50 Min, so 4 Hours of nothing.. great.

        - I don't know how to solve the deadlock, I think it can't be solved, I am thinking of an alternative.
        
        - I took a day off (visitors to my house).

        - I asked on discord a bit, it gave me insight that my function design itself is wrong, very wrong infact.
          I can't really point out where the mistkae happened it was more of a snowball effect,
          My tl;dr on what not to do:

            #HERE
            + Layout all classes & functions in files or single file after designing the UML.
            + Every now and then compile the file, maybe every 5 minutes or after finishing each section.
            + I'd say code from top to bottom, but that's after the first +.
            + Isolate the bugs you face, don't jump to searching for them on google.
            + Use automated scripts if you can in any of those steps.
            + The main bug I had can be found in bug.cpp

        - Both solutions had their problems, I decided to ditch the `eBookSystemIO` class entierly.

        - I am finally back on track after: 7 hours.

        - Since I got out of that hole it has been steady process I guess,
          some design violations here and there though.
        
        - I realized that HelperFunctions.cpp can be more efficient using Templates.

        - After some time coding and few bugs here and there the Project is nearly finished BUT:
          `SessionManager` showed a problem, I need to show sessions for particular `CustomerUser` Only,
          also need to limit choose to sessions of that `CustomerUser`.

        - I changed the data structure (In `SessionManager`) from vector to map,
          now there are other bugs. Mainly, SaveSessions() doesn't work,
          NewSession() breaks after the second time somehow!

        - After some thought, I think UserManager having SessionManager might have been a better idea,
          or more like, there's class Manager(s) which we generally have one instance of it.
          The way I designed it, I made each CustoemrUser his own UserManager, which might have not been
          a good idea.... When am I going to get better at this?!


        - Project is finally finished.

        - TO-DO - Extras :) -:
            + Organize files.
            + Add ability of adding range to PrintLine().
            + Make blackbox test.

    - OO-Revision (~2 hour - 30 min):
        - Nothing much other than reading solution, and re-reading code generally.

After seeing solution:

    - See #HERE

    - I totally missed adding something like `vector<string> pages`,
      which is kind of funny, because that's all what's the proejct about :D

    - This way of Model/View, I think it's already outdated after the secodn half of the course,
      so I am not sure if I'd do it in the final project.
    
    - Solution used same class for Admin and Customer, I may cut corners on somethings (getters/setters :D),
      I'd never put those two in the same pool.

    - I think my solution is more cmoplex for no particular reason.

    - I am unable to pinpoint a particular mistake I made, it's not that my solution is good.
      more like I am too incomptent to notice mentioned mistakes, obviously better than AskMeOOP Project,
      but aside from obviously mistakes I made in AskMeOOP, I can't find anything in particular here, 
      except that it's a different deisgn of course.
      => Can't say in virtual certanity "Here I made a mistkae, I shouldn't do it again.", like last project.

    - I noticed a small thing while trying to design ExpediaProject,
      My desings are very... "linear",
      unlike Doctor's solutions, he uses `UserManager` to let's say sign in, then comes back to `ProjectSystem`,
      in my projects I use `UserManager` to access other functionalities & classes. Hmmmm.
