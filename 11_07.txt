Adobe Photostop inherits from Image Editor, and overrided Draw(),
Adope Photostop has shapes[] inherited from ImageEditor.

an Image editor can have from 0 - inifinty shaapes in it. also it's a composition relationship (has-a).

Rectangle & Circle inherit from Shape, both have common data member Color,
yet both overridded ComputeArea() & Draw(), also they added data members of their own.

No particular thoughts about implementation, other than shouldn't Image editor have has-a to Rectangle and Circle too?
