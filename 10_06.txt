I guess same as in previous one, 
we will have repeated functions in Copier class from Printer and Scanner,
because both of them inherit from PoweredDevice,
not sure if that's really the  problem.

it should be:
    PoweredDevice => Printer, Scanner, Copier.
    All-in-one => Printer, Scanner, Copier.
