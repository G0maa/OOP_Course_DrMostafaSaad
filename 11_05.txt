What is happening here? I am confused.

although hello() accepts a pointer of class A only,
it accepted pointer of class C.

also pointer of A accepted new of C.

About the output, I'd say pointers always print their functions so:
    hello will change the inherited x in A.
    and will print "I am A".

    then again,
    change inherited x in A
    then print "I am A"

    I am C
    I am A

    deletion is as always inreverse, I think type of pointer wouldn't matter?
    (After seeing solution, it actually does... forgot to reverse those here too.)
    A Destrucotr
    B Destructor
    C Destructor
    A Destrucotr
    B Destructor
    C Destructor
    


all data members are visible, they're all in public.
but for hello() only x is visible.
